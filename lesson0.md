# Lesson 0: Hello World of HPC

Welcome to your first HPC lesson!  In this lesson, we'll explore the exciting world of High-Performance Computing.

## What is HPC?

High-Performance Computing (HPC) involves using powerful computers, often in clusters, to solve complex problems that would be too time-consuming or impossible for regular computers.

## Our First Step

Let's start with a simple "Hello World" example.  While printing "Hello World" might seem trivial, it's a fundamental step in any programming journey.  In the HPC context, it can represent a basic test of your setup.

```bash
echo "Hello World from HPC!"
