# Lesson 1: OpenMP Parallel Sections

## Overview

This lesson demonstrates **OpenMP parallel sections**, allowing independent tasks to run concurrently using multiple threads.

### **Key Concepts Covered:**
- Parallelizing independent tasks using `#pragma omp sections`
- Understanding **thread safety** and **race conditions**
- **HPC performance analysis**: thread scheduling, I/O contention, and load imbalance

---

## 📌 **C Code: OpenMP Parallel Sections Example**

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // stdio.h - Potential I/O bottleneck in parallel execution
#include <omp.h>     // omp.h - OpenMP API for parallel computing

/*
  This program demonstrates OpenMP sections.
  Sections allow independent tasks to execute in parallel.

  ✅ Inputs: None
  ✅ Outputs: Prints messages from parallel sections.
*/

// Task A
void task_a() {
  printf("Task A is executed by thread %d\n", omp_get_thread_num());
  // 🔍 Thread Safety Concern: printf in parallel task → serialization risk
  // 🔍 HPC Impact: I/O bottleneck due to potential contention
}

// Task B
void task_b() {
  printf("Task B is executed by thread %d\n", omp_get_thread_num());
  // 🔍 Same concerns as task_a → analyze I/O contention
}

// Task C
void task_c() {
  printf("Task C is executed by thread %d\n", omp_get_thread_num());
  // 🔍 Audit thread safety if shared resources are introduced later
}

int main() {
  printf("Starting OpenMP parallel sections example.\n");

  // 🚀 OpenMP Parallel Sections Begin
  #pragma omp parallel sections
  {
    #pragma omp section
    { task_a(); } // 🚨 Race condition risk if shared data is used

    #pragma omp section
    { task_b(); } // 🚨 Ensure thread independence

    #pragma omp section
    { task_c(); } // 🚨 Synchronization required if shared state is modified
  }

  // 🔄 Implicit Barrier at End of Parallel Sections
  // 📌 HPC Impact:
  // - Threads synchronize here before continuing
  // - Load imbalance may occur if tasks have different execution times

  printf("Finished parallel sections example.\n");
  return 0;
}
```

## 🚀 **Deep Dive: HPC Analysis & Optimization**

### **🛠 Performance Bottlenecks**
✅ **I/O Contention:**  
- Multiple `printf` calls inside parallel tasks may cause **serialization delays**.  
- **Recommendation:** Use **buffered logging** instead of direct `printf`.

✅ **Thread Safety & Race Conditions:**  
- If `task_a`, `task_b`, or `task_c` modify shared data, **race conditions** may occur.  
- **Solution:** Use `#pragma omp critical` or `atomic` for safe access.

✅ **Load Balancing Issues:**  
- OpenMP **implicitly synchronizes** threads at the end of `#pragma omp sections`.
- **Problem:** If one section runs longer than others, **idle threads waste resources**.
- **Fix:** Consider **dynamic scheduling** or **task-based parallelism**.

## 📌 **Key Takeaways**
🔹 OpenMP `#pragma omp sections` is ideal for **independent tasks**.  
🔹 **Thread safety audits** are crucial when introducing shared resources.  
🔹 **Performance tuning** is necessary to reduce **I/O bottlenecks & thread imbalance**.  

➡ **Next Steps:**  
- Try replacing `printf` with **non-blocking logging mechanisms**.  
- Experiment with **different OpenMP scheduling strategies**.
