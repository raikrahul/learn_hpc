# Lesson 7: Optimizing OpenMP Code

This lesson explores common performance pitfalls in OpenMP code and provides strategies for optimization. We'll analyze a flawed example and demonstrate how to address its shortcomings.

## Step 1: OpenMP API Review

Let's quickly recap the OpenMP directives and functions relevant to this lesson:

*   `omp_get_thread_num()`: Returns the ID of the current thread within a parallel region.
*   `omp_single`: Ensures that a block of code is executed by only one thread.
*   `omp_barrier`: Synchronizes all threads in a team.
*   `reduction`: Performs a reduction operation (e.g., sum, min, max) in parallel, combining thread-local results safely.

## Step 2: Code Example and Analysis

The following C code calculates the number of positive elements in each row of a 2D array and computes the total sum of positive elements.  However, it's riddled with inefficiencies and bad practices.

```c
// filename: count_positives.c
// Compilation instructions: gcc -fopenmp count_positives.c -o count_positives

#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // For malloc and free
#include <string.h> // For memcpy

int main(int argc, char* argv) {
    int rows = 4;
    int cols = 16;
    int (*data)[cols] = malloc(rows * sizeof *data); // Dynamically allocate the 2D array
    if (data == NULL) {
        perror("Memory allocation failed");
        return 1;
    }
    int positive_counts[rows];
    int total_sum = 0;

    // Initialize the 2D array 'data' with values - Directly, more efficiently
    int initial_data[rows][cols] = {
        {123, 3,  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
        {6, 9, 10, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
        {2, 3,  4, 5, 6, 8, 1, 3, 3, 3, 9, 3, 6, 8, 6, 9},
        {2, 9,  4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
    };
    memcpy(data, initial_data, sizeof(initial_data)); // Use memcpy for efficient copying

#pragma omp parallel num_threads(4) shared(rows, cols, data, positive_counts) reduction(+:total_sum)
    {
        int my_row = omp_get_thread_num();

        positive_counts[my_row] = 0; // Initialize positive counts for this row

        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (data[my_row][j] > 0) {
                positive_counts[my_row]++;
                total_sum += data[my_row][j]; // Reduction is now handled correctly
            }
        }
    }

    printf("The total sum of positive numbers is %d\n", total_sum);
    for (int k = 0; k < rows; k++) {
        printf("Row %d has %d positive numbers.\n", k, positive_counts[k]);
    }

    free(data); // Free the dynamically allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```

## Step 3: Analysis of Issues and Improvements

The original code (not shown here, but assumed to have the flaws described in the prompt) had several flaws:

1.  **Inefficient Initialization:** The nested loop copy was replaced with `memcpy`. Direct initialization of the dynamically allocated array is even more efficient if possible.
2.  **Cache Unfriendly Access:** The column-wise iteration was not ideal. Row-major access is generally preferred when data is stored row-major. The provided code accesses the data in a cache-friendly way.
3.  **Redundant `omp single` and `omp barrier`:** These were removed. The `memcpy` is now outside the parallel region, and the reduction handles synchronization.
4.  **Limited Scalability:** The number of threads is still hardcoded. For production, consider reading this from an environment variable or command line argument.
5.  **Inefficient Reduction:** The `reduction` clause is now used correctly, eliminating the need for manual synchronization and improving performance.
6.  **Unnecessary Parallel Overhead:** The parallel region is now more focused, only encompassing the computationally intensive part.
7.  **I/O Bottleneck:** The `printf` statements are now outside the parallel region, reducing I/O contention.
8.  **Memory Management:** The code now correctly allocates memory dynamically using `malloc` and frees it using `free`, preventing memory leaks.

## Step 4: Further Optimizations

*   **Dynamic Scheduling:** For uneven workloads, consider using dynamic scheduling: `#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic)`
*   **Vectorization:** Explore compiler optimizations for vectorization.
*   **Profiling:** Use a profiler to identify performance bottlenecks.

This revised example demonstrates more efficient and idiomatic OpenMP usage.  Remember to always consider memory management, cache behavior, and proper synchronization when writing parallel code.
