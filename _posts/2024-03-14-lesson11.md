|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `omp_get_thread_num()`   | Returns the ID of the current thread within a team. Master thread is 0.        |
| `omp parallel`           | Creates a team of threads to execute a structured block in parallel.       |
| `num_threads()`          | Clause to specify the number of threads in a parallel region.              |
| `omp_set_num_threads()`  | Sets the number of threads for subsequent parallel regions.                 |
| `omp_get_num_threads()`  | Returns the number of threads currently in a team executing a parallel region. |
| `omp_get_max_threads()`  | Returns the maximum number of threads available.                           |
| `omp_in_parallel()`      | Returns true if the calling thread is inside a parallel region.             |
| `omp_get_dynamic()`      | Checks if dynamic thread adjustment is enabled.                             |
| `omp_set_dynamic()`      | Enables or disables dynamic thread adjustment.                               |
| `omp_get_wtime()`        | Returns elapsed wall clock time in seconds.                                |
| `omp_get_wtick()`        | Returns the precision of `omp_get_wtime()` in seconds.                       |
| `omp for` / `omp do`     | Distributes loop iterations across threads.                                  |
| `omp sections`           | Assigns independent code blocks to different threads.                       |
| `omp single`             | Specifies a code block to be executed by only one thread.                   |
| `omp master`             | Specifies a code block to be executed by the master thread only.            |
| `omp critical`           | Ensures that a code block is executed by only one thread at a time.          |
| `omp atomic`             | Ensures that a specific memory location is updated atomically.              |
| `omp ordered`            | Ensures that code blocks within a loop are executed in a specific order.      |
| `omp barrier`            | Synchronizes all threads in a team.                                        |
| `omp flush`              | Ensures that all threads have a consistent view of shared memory.           |
| `omp reduction`          | Performs a reduction operation on a shared variable.                         |
| `omp task`               | Defines a unit of work that can be executed asynchronously.                  |
| `omp taskgroup`          | Creates a group of tasks.                                                  |
| `omp depend`             | Specifies dependencies between tasks.                                      |
| `omp cancellation_point` | Defines a point where a task can be cancelled.                              |
| `omp cancel`             | Requests cancellation of a task or task group.                             |
| `omp target`             | Offloads code and data to a target device (e.g., GPU).                     |
| `omp teams`              | Creates a team of threads on a target device.                             |
| `omp distribute`         | Distributes work across teams.                                             |
