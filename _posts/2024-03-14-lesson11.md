## OpenMP Tasking Features

Below is a table of the OpenMP APIs and concepts focusing on tasking features:

| API/Concept                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `#pragma omp task`              | Creates a new task. The code within the structured block is executed by the new task.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `shared(list)`                  | Data scoping clause for tasks. Variables in the list are shared between the task and the surrounding context.                                                                                                                         |
| `private(list)`                 | Data scoping clause for tasks. Each task gets its own private copy of the variables in the list.                                                                                                                                        |
| `firstprivate(list)`            | Data scoping clause for tasks. Each task gets a private copy of the variables, initialized with the value from the surrounding context.                                                                                             |
| `default(shared|none)`          | Data scoping clause for tasks. Specifies the default data sharing attribute for variables within the task.                                                                                                                             |
| `#pragma omp barrier`           | Synchronizes all threads in the current team. All tasks created by these threads are guaranteed to be completed at the barrier.                                                                                                        |
| `#pragma omp taskwait`          | The encountering task is suspended until all its child tasks have completed. Applies only to direct children, not descendants.                                                                                                         |
| `#pragma omp parallel`          | Creates a team of threads. Often used to initiate parallel execution of tasks.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `#pragma omp single`            | Specifies that a block of code should be executed by only one thread in the team. Other threads wait.                                                                                                                                   |
| `#pragma omp sections`          | Specifies that different code blocks (sections) should be executed by different threads.                                                                                                                                             |
| `if` clause                     | Conditional task creation. If the expression evaluates to false, the task is executed immediately by the current thread (no new task created). Used for optimization to avoid creating very small tasks.                           |
| `untied` clause                 | Tasks created with this clause are not tied to a specific thread. They can be suspended and resumed by different threads.                                                                                                             |
| `#pragma omp taskyield`         | Suggests to the runtime that the current task can be suspended to allow other tasks to run. A hint for optimization or deadlock prevention.                                                                                              |
| `#pragma omp taskgroup`         | Creates a group of tasks. `taskwait` within a taskgroup waits for the completion of all tasks in that group.                                                                                                                            |
| `#pragma omp taskloop`          | Parallelizes a loop by creating a task for each chunk of iterations. Combines task creation with loop distribution.                                                                                                                       |
| `grainsize(size)`               | Clause for `taskloop`. Specifies the minimum size of loop chunks assigned to each task.                                                                                                                                                |
| `num_tasks(count)`              | Clause for `taskloop`. Specifies the number of tasks to create for the loop.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `priority(value)`               | Clause for `task`. A hint to the runtime about task execution order (higher priority tasks recommended to run first), but it is not a guarantee.                                                                                       |
| `final(expr)`                   | Clause for `task`. If `expr` evaluates to true, the task is considered final. No new tasks will be generated within it. Used to stop recursion.                                                                                      |
| `mergeable` clause              | Clause for `task`. Hints that the task's data environment might be merged with its parent's if it's undeferred (if clause is false) or included (final clause is true). Note: Compiler/runtime support for this is not yet mature. |
